            <h2>Climate Change: The Challenge of the 21st Century</h2>
            <p>Climate change is one of the greatest challenges humanity faces in the 21st century. The Paris Agreement has set important goals to achieve global carbon neutrality by 2050, but the path to reaching this goal remains long and arduous. Recent reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) emphasize that the risks associated with climate change are approaching faster and more severely than we had previously predicted. Without immediate action, the catastrophic consequences of rising global temperatures will continue to destroy lives, homes, livelihoods, and cultures of millions of people around the world.</p>

            <h2>The Emission Zero Project</h2>
            <p>The Emission Zero project was born in response to these urgent calls for action. We believe that by encouraging consumers and businesses to participate in carbon markets, we can positively impact the price of carbon credits by increasing demand. This will incentivize businesses to make more environmentally conscious decisions. Emission Zero is a groundbreaking cryptocurrency project built on the Solana blockchain platform. We have developed the Emission Zero (EMZ) token, a cryptocurrency supported by carbon emission reduction projects. Each EMZ token represents one ton of CO2 reduced, and its value will increase by 20% every three years.</p>

        <div class="part-section part-c">
            <h2>The Mission of Emission Zero</h2>
            <p>The mission of Emission Zero is to provide consumers and businesses with the necessary tools to participate in the world’s largest carbon markets through blockchain technology, thereby revolutionizing climate action. By creating a comprehensive ecosystem, we not only facilitate emission reductions but also encourage sustainable development.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="part-section part-d">
            <h1>Part A: Introduction</h1>
            <p>The Carbon Credit Market plays a crucial role in global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change. This market is divided into two main segments: the mandatory carbon credit market and the voluntary carbon credit market.</p>

            <div class="illustration">
                <img src="C:\Users\Gigabyte H310\Desktop\chay\anh wep\7.png" alt="Carbon Credit Market Illustration">
            </div>

            <h3>Mandatory Carbon Credit Market</h3>
            <p>The mandatory carbon credit market is regulated by governments and international organizations. Participating companies must comply with emission quotas set by regulatory agencies. If a company's emissions exceed the quota, they must purchase additional carbon credits from the market. A prime example is the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), which accounts for approximately 90% of the global carbon credit market value. In 2021, the EU ETS was valued at around 760 billion EUR (approximately 899 billion USD), with a growth rate of 164% compared to 2020.</p>

            <h3>Voluntary Carbon Credit Market</h3>
            <p>The voluntary carbon credit market allows individuals and companies to purchase carbon credits to offset their emissions without being legally required to do so. These credits are typically issued by environmental projects such as reforestation, forest conservation, and other emission reduction activities. This market reached a value of approximately 2 billion USD in 2021, an increase of 282% compared to 2020. Voluntary carbon credits are usually verified by non-governmental organizations such as Verra and Gold Standard.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="part-section part-e">
            <h1>Part B: Market Overview</h1>
            <p>Market Potential: The carbon credit market is experiencing strong growth. The EU ETS is not only the largest carbon trading system in the world but also one of the fastest-growing markets. In 2021, the price of an EUA credit increased from around 25 EUR to over 60 EUR, indicating strong demand and value growth. The voluntary market is rapidly increasing as businesses and individuals seek to offset their emissions. In 2021, the price of voluntary credits increased from 1-3 USD to 15-20 USD per credit, reflecting significant market growth.</p>

            <h3>Market Challenges</h3>
            <p>Despite its potential, the carbon credit market faces several challenges: Emission Reduction Measurement and Verification is a complex and costly process, especially for voluntary carbon credit projects. The lack of standardization and transparency in this process leads to doubts about the accuracy of the credits. Voluntary Credit Trading lacks a centralized and standardized trading infrastructure, making it difficult to trade and verify credits. This also reduces the market's liquidity. Cost and Barriers to Entry are significant for many small businesses and individuals.</p>

            <h3>Opportunities for Emission Zero</h3>
            <p>Emission Zero sees these challenges as opportunities to develop and provide groundbreaking solutions. By leveraging blockchain technology, Emission Zero creates a transparent, secure, and efficient system for trading carbon credits. This system simplifies the measurement and verification process, reduces costs, and creates a more standardized carbon credit market. This not only helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions but also encourages businesses and individuals to actively participate in environmental protection projects.</p>
